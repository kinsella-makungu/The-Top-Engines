                        <p class="category-item-desc">A convertible or a cabriolet is a vehicle that has a roof that can be removed or folded down. When it comes to the roof, it comes in two types: hard-top and soft-top. A hard-top uses steel or plastic and operates automatically. While a soft-top utilizes a textile material such as vinyl or canvas, allowing the roof to be pulled up or left down smoothly. A convertible is often considered a luxury car due to its elegant appearance and feeling of freedom.

                        <p class="category-item-desc">The most noticeable part of a hatchback is its hatch or a rear door that swings upward. It usually comes with two or four doors, excluding the trunk's door. Hatchbacks are very similar to sedans, with both categorized as passenger cars. The biggest difference between them is their cargo capacity. Hatchbacks typically haul more pieces of cargo compared to their sedan counterparts. Moreover, you can remove bulky shopping bags or other heavy pieces more easily. If you prioritize increased cargo capacity and better fuel economy, then a hatchback can be a good fit for you.</p>

                        <p class="category-item-desc">A hybrid vehicle is one that uses two or more distinct types of power, such as submarines that use diesel when surfaced and batteries when submerged. Other means to store energy include pressurized fluid in hydraulic hybrids.<br><br>

                            The basic principle with hybrid vehicles is that the different motors work better at different speeds; the electric motor is more efficient at producing torque, or turning power, and the combustion engine is better for maintaining high speed than a typical electric motor. Switching from one to the other at the proper time while speeding up yields a win-win in terms of energy efficiency.<br>

                        <p class="category-item-desc">If we had to summarize crossovers in a single phrase, it would be "a combination of an SUV and a hatchback". Crossovers have the practicality of an SUV but also come with superb fuel efficiency like hatchbacks do, as they are built on a unibody construction that is lighter and consumes less fuel.<br> 
                         <br>   Example: Volvo XC60, Mazda CX-5</p>

                        <p class="category-item-desc">By definition, sports cars are two-seater convertibles that allow for open-air driving and have a sporty appearance. Automakers have incorporated remarkable features such as nimble maneuverability, excellent acceleration, and great handling into their sports cars, contributing significantly their huge amount of power and thrilling ride.

                        <p class="category-item-desc">A Sport Utility Vehicle(SUV) is defined by its off-road capabilities and roominess. It boasts a comfortable ride in rough, rugged cross-country terrain. It offers a relatively high seating position which allows a better view of the road. These functionalities have been made possible by its sturdy body-on-frame construction that is borrowed from trucks. Hence, if you are one of those who enjoy outdoor adventure and expect to tow dirt bikes, an SUV might be best suited to you.
                         <br>   Example: Honda CR-V, Audi RS7</p>
